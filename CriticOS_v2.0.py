# DESCRIPTION: A program designed to explore and redefine the concept of
#              a critic and critical identity, moving from singular to
#              cyborg.
# STATUS: Online

# “Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall,
# the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, 
# before writing, 
# before Man. 
# Cyborg writing is about the power to survive,
# not on the basis of original innocence, 
# but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them 
# as other.” [1]

# Bakhtin: Refers to Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of Heteroglossia, crucial for multi-voiced analysis.
